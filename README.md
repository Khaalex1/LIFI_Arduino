# LIFI_Arduino

Arduino academic project made with my friend J. FOYANG NZEDOM during our first year in engineering school, in particular for the Digital Electronics course delivered by Dr. B. ZERR.

It illustrates a LIFI communication using the rudimentary modulation technique known as PPM : 
to make it simple, to each letter of the alphabet corresponds a certain duration of light emission, which is its signature.

A code was used for a simulation in SimulIDE while another (practically the same code) was used for a physical Arduino card.

Further explanations are provided in the report (in french).
