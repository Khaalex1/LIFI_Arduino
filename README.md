# LIFI_Arduino

Arduino academic project made with my friend J. FOYANG NZEDOM during our first year in engineering school, for the Digital Electronics course.

It illustrates a LIFI communication using the rudimentary modulation technique known as PPM : 
to make it simple, to each letter of the alphabet corresponds a certain duration of light emission, which is its signature.

A code was used for a simulation in SimulIDE while another (practically the same code) was used for a physical Arduino card.

The tests in the simulation aswell as with the physical card, prove that the PPM modulation is a viable and easy technique to implement. However we must note that it is rather unprotected and that it is sensitive to external perturbations.

Further explanations are provided in the report (in french).
